<h1>SSO Integration</h1>
<p>
    Single Sign-On (SSO) is a method of access control of multiple related, but 
    independent software systems. With this method a user logs in once and gains 
    access to all systems without being prompted to log in again at each of them.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to note that while SSO once implemented is incredibly easy
    for end users, it is very complicated for technical staff to implement and
    requires high levels of resources and knowledge.
</p>
<p>
    CompliSpace Fundamentals supports two methods of SSO suitable to different
    needs and in-house skill sets available for implementation.
</p>
<h2>SSO Using SAML 2.0</h2>
<p>
    CompliSpace supports the <a href="https://wiki.oasis-open.org/security/FrontPage">SAML 2.0 protocol</a>.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    CompliSpace Technology supports this single sign-on experience as the integration 
    of a SAML 2.0 compliant Identity Provider (IdP) you have already installed and made operational. 
    CompliSpace Technology will do it's best to provide support with the SAML protocol, however 
    your Identity Provider (IdP) is a third-party product and therefore CompliSpace Technology
    does not provide detailed support for the deployment, configuration, troubleshooting, best practices, etc. 
    Issues and questions regarding your Identity Provider (IdP) should be directed to
    your vendor.
</div>
<p>
    CompliSpace Technology recommends that you engage <a href="http://studentnet.net/">Student Net</a>
    for your identity requirements.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">
    If you do not already have extensive experience with implementing and
    configuring SAML 2.0 Identity Providers, CompliSpace Technology 
    <b>highly</b> recommends against doing this your self.
</div>
<p>
    For those using Microsoft products, ADFS provides some level of SAML support.
</p>
<div class="alert">
    It has been our experience that many Microsoft Certified Partners have no
    more than an 'able to install the software' level of knowledge when it comes
    to SAML integration and struggle when it comes to actual implementation.
</div>
<p>
    Integrating with CompliSpace Fundamentals using SAML 2.0 allows your directory
    to tell CompliSpace details about the user such as name and email address. It
    also has the advantage that access permissions in Fundamentals are controlled
    by your directory, allowing a single 'source of truth' without having to manage
    permissions separately inside Fundamentals.

<h2>SSO Using Referred Sign In</h2>
<p>
    CompliSpace Fundamentals supports a mechanism where a URL to Fundamentals 
    can be signed by a trusted source. The signature includes the user that is to
    be signed in along with an expiration that can be no more than 6 hours.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
    If you are familiar with how AWS signs access to S3 objects you will feel at home!
</div>
<p>
    This method is good when you don't want to invest in the infrastructure of
    identity management, but already have a small portal or web page (often an intranet)
    where your users have already authenticated.
</p>
<p>
    Referred sign in allows your portal page to create a unique link for each user
    such that when they follow it to Fundamentals they will be logged in automatically.
</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>
        You must have server side web programming skills and access to 
        your portal's server side scripting to implement Referred Sign In. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You should be familiar with concepts such as HMAC, SHA and BASE64 encoding.
    </p>
