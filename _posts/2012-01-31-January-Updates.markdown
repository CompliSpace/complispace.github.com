##Change Log
This month there are 6 specific issues.


###Issue 381 - "Updated" or "New" bubble for Fundamentals pages
After a page has been published it will now have a bubble in the top right corner
marking the page as "New" or "Updated".

The appropriate label will be applied for 2 weeks after the page is published.

###Issue 384 - Link to Training Room in Automatic Test emails
Previously the automated email sent to a user when assigned a test had a link to
the Tests Assigned page. It now also includes a link to the training room with the text:

<div style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 1em;">
For more information on this topic, please visit the <strong>training room</strong>.
</div>

...where the words **training room** is a link to the Fundamentals Training Room page.

###Issue 385 - CompliFlow Questions Numbering Not Incrementing
Opera based browsers were not increasing the question number on CompliFlow forms.

This has been corrected.

###Issue 394 - Browser education links not printed
The links [Which browser for me?](http://whichbrowserforme.org/) and 
[What exactly is a web browser?](http://whatbrowser.org/) no longer appear when 
printed.

###Issue 398 - Show Google chrome frame plugin link for IE < Version 8
The advise to install Chrome Frame Plugin link will now only appear for IE browsers
older than version 8. 

CompliSpace Technology strongly encourages **all internet explorer users** to install
the [Google Chrome Frame Plugin](http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/)

###Issue 406 - Support for iOS media streaming
The underlying Komodo CMS system has been patched to support the streaming methods
used by the iOS platform. Streaming media such as MP4 movies will now work 
correctly on devices that use iOS.

For this to work correctly, please ensure that the link to the media file has
the option 'Force Download' set to 'No'. If this is set to 'Yes' media streaming
will not work.
