##Introduction
It's been a while since we rolled out updates for Fundamentals, but we've been
busy working away in the background building new products, preparing major 
upgrades to our infrastructure and of course improving Fundamentals.

##Schedule
May updates are scheduled to take place on Thursday 23rd May with no 
disruption to services expected. If a client has unusual behaviour, be sure to 
have them [clear their cache][Clear Cache].

##Change Log
This month there are 18 specific issues.

###Issue-818: CompliFlow Not Working On IE 9/10
Internet Explorer 9/10 has a bug where it doesn't correctly handle certain 
characters in form field names. We have made a work around until Microsoft fix
this bug. Don't hold your breath.
