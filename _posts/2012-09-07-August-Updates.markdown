##Change Log
This month there are 5 specific issues.

###Issue-521: Adding Extra Fields Under Drop-down box in Injury/Incident tool
The "Nature of Incident" drop down box can be customised for your needs. Please
contact support if you would like this modified.

###Issue-529: Normalise internal API
In some cases the "Online Library" was not accepting new categories. This has now
been corrected.

###Issue-517: Failed Login Attempt message when login not yet attempted
When first visiting a page before signing in, a message was being displayed saying 
that your login failed. This is no longer displayed until you have tried to sign in and failed.

###Issue-522: Various improvements to underlying SQL
Internal SQL has been updated to be more streamlined.

###Issue-531: Extremely long names now wrap better in the previous/next navigation bar
Extremely long page names were breaking the flow for the navigation bar. This has
been improved to support better wrapping.

<div class="alert alert-info">

CompliSpace Technology strongly advises that for an improved user experience short,
 descriptive names should be used for pages. Please see the

how to write for an online audience.
