##Issue #184 - Protection of CompliAdmin user
Some clients have deleted the CompliAdmin user. This login is used by CompliSpace
to update and manage the customer Fundamentals software. Without this user, policies
can not be amended or added as appropriate.

The CompliSpace user can now only be edited or deleted by the CompliSpace Developer.
