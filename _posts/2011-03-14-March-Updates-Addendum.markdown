##Change Log
One more *high priority* issue has been added to the [update schedule for March
2011](/2011/03/09/March-Updates.html). All other information remains the same.

###Issue 209 - IE trying to open Office 2007 files as zip files
Some combinations of Internet Explorer / Windows and various 'updates'
result in Microsoft Internet Explorer trying to open Microsoft Office
2007 and greater documents as ZIP files. This patch will help Internet
Explorer recognise the documents as Office documents and open them in
the correct applications.

It is highly recommended that Internet Explorer user upgrade to a web
browser that complies better with modern web standards. A list of
browsers can be found at the <a

If you must use Internet Explorer for use with legacy applications, we
recommend installing the <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe/index.html">Google Chrome Frame plugin</a>. This will allow
you to continue using Internet Explorer on you legacy applications,
while using the Chrome rendering engine on modern sites.

Technically Microsoft Office 2007 and greater files *are* ZIP files -
you can change the extension on any of these documents to `.zip` and
open them to see the contents. It is interesting to note that
it is only the Microsoft browser that doesn't recognise the files as
being Microsoft documents!
