##Standardised Email Addresses

In the [May 2012 updates](/Update/2012/05/30/May-Updates.html) we standardised all emails being sent from the CompliSpace
Fundamentals system. Please ensure that your personal and company spam filters
are configured to allow the following email addresses:


`noreply@complispace.com`  
`helpdesk@complispace.com`


Please consult your internal support on how to white list these email addresses
