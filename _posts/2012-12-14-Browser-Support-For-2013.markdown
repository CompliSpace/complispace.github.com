##Welcome HTML5!
CompliSpace Technology will be very busy in 2013 with big plans for 
extending the existing Fundamentals platform, as well as creating a few more products!

As I'm sure you are aware, the Internet and web technology are continually growing
and maturing. Of particular interest is the maturity of [web standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards).

To ensure that CompliSpace positively contributes to good net citizenship and so we
can deliver first class software, we will no longer be supporting older
versions of web browsers that don't comply with modern standards as set out by the
[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG) (WHATWG).

##Supported Browsers
The list below shows the browsers that we will be officially supporting from January 2013. Older versions may work
for you, but we will be unable to assist with any problems you may have while using
unsupported browsers.

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) > 21
* [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) > 15
* [Apple Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) > 4
* [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) > 10
* [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/internet-explorer/download-ie) >= 8 (does not include Windows XP or older)


##Internet Explorer
While version 8 of Internet Explorer is quite old, we recognise that many businesses
have legacy applications that require older browsers such as IE 8.

If you must use Internet Explorer, we recommend that you always use the most recent version
and to install the [Google Chrome Frame plugin](http://www.google.com/chromeframe). 
This plugin doesn't replace your browser, it just provides an improved way of 
displaying pages for sites that support the plugin, such as CompliSpace Fundamentals.

##Windows XP
From January 2013 we will no longer provide support for any version of Internet Explorer
running on Windows XP.

Windows XP was released 11 years ago and reached the [end of its mainstream support](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/products/lifecycle#section_2)
from Microsoft in April 2009. In an effort by Microsoft to move people
away from their old operating system and purchase a more modern version of Windows they have
built Internet Explorer version 9 and above to require Windows Vista or later.

Fortunately for those who still use Windows XP, the other browser vendors do allow
their browsers to work on Windows XP. If you are using Windows XP, we recommend
you use one of the other browsers.
