##Welcome HTML5!
CompliSpace Technology will be very busy in 2013 with big plans for 
extending the existing Fundamentals platform as well as creating a few more products!

As I'm sure you are aware, the Internet and web technology are continually growing
and maturing. In particular is the maturity of [web standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards).

To ensure that we positively contribute to good net citizenship and so that we
can continue to deliver first class software, we will no longer be supporting older
versions of web browsers that don't comply with modern standards as set out by the
[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG) (WHATWG).

##Supported Browsers
From January 2013, the browsers that we officially support are listed below. Older versions may work
for you, but we will be unable to assist with any problems you may have while using an 
unsupported browsers.

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) > 21
* [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) > 15
* [Apple Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) > 4
* [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) > 10
* [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/internet-explorer/download-ie) >= 8 (does not include Windows XP or older)


##Internet Explorer
While version 8 of Internet Explorer is quite old, we recognise that many business
applications have legacy applications that require older browsers such as IE 8.

If you must use Internet Explorer, we recommend that you always use the most recent version
and to install the [Google Chrome Frame plugin](http://www.google.com/chromeframe). 
This plugin doesn't replace your browser, it just provides an improved way of 
displaying pages for sites that support the plugin. Sites such as CompliSpace Fundamentals.

##Windows XP
From January 2013 we will no longer provide support for any version of Internet Explorer
running on Windows XP.

Windows XP was released 11 years ago and reached the [end of it's main stream support](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/products/lifecycle#section_2)
from Microsoft in April 2009 - 3.5 years ago. In an effort by Microsoft to move people
away from their old operating system and purchase a more modern version of Windows they have
built Internet Explorer version 9 and above to require Windows Vista or later.

Fortunately for those who still use Windows XP, the other browser vendors do allow
their browsers to work on Windows XP. If you are using Windows XP, we recommend that
you use one of the other browsers.
