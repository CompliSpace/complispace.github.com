CompliSpace Development is in the process of establishing it's
[presence on GitHub](https://github.com/complispace).

This blog will be a fairly informal place for CompliSpace Development to
interact with the outside world! The CompliSpace product is primarily focussed
on delivering great organisational content and it does so well. The sales team
can easily show you how great the product is. However this content is delivered
using _technology_.

Here is where you can pull back the curtain and get a glimpse into the busy
development world at CompliSpace.

If you need technical support, please contact the help desk by calling
__+61 2 9299 6105__ or sending an email to <contactus@complispace.com.au>

You can contact CompliSpace Development through email: <development@complispace.net>
