##Change Log
This month there are 8 specific issues.

###Issue-415: Back/Forward navigation broken when using charsets outside of UTF-8
Non-standard UTF8 characters in page titles were causing the navigation links to
display broken. These characters are now stripped.

###Issue 427: Google Search form now defaults to 'Search the World'
Many customers have asked that the Google Search form (content item) default to
'Search the World' instead of 'Search Australia'

###Issue 433: Older Adobe PDF plugin failing to load large PDF files
Older PDF plugins failed to load large PDF files. This has been addressed.

###Issue 437: Photo selection in Staff Directory not working
In some cases the staff directory photo selection was not working. This has now
been addressed.

###Issue 439: Sitemap actions not working on sites with many pages
Sites with large numbers of pages were having problems with the sitemap. This is
no longer a problem.

###Issue 451: Remove 'new' button from header Q2A link
Since the Q2A is no longer new, the label has been removed.

###Issue 434: Clients not being able to reset their own passwords
Some clients were having problems when trying to reset their passwords. This has 
been fixed.

###Issue 443: Assessment report resolution is too fine grained
Assessment report resolution now works better with smaller intervals.
