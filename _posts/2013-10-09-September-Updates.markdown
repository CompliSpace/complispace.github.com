##Schedule
September updates are scheduled to take place on Thursday 17th October with no
disruption to services expected. If a client has unusual behaviour, be sure to
have them [clear their cache][Clear Cache].

##Change Log
The Developers have been working hard to bring you new features and *lots* of bug fixes!

We've also moved to using Jira by Atlassian for our issue tracking so you will notice some differences in the issue id format.

The volume of issues we are addressing makes it impractical for us to list each one, so instead we will now list only the "Big Ticket" things.

###FM-41 Project Blue Beard
To cut a long story short, the Fundamentals code was forked away from Komodo CMS years ago. We've been providing our own enhancements and bug fixes and heading in a different direction. While the original Komodo CMS is designed for public web sites, Fundamentals requires strict security and specialised functionality. To avoid confusion, we have updated a lot of references so you know the software you are using is maintained and secured by CompliSpace Technology.

###FM-8 Simplified Permissions
The permission system is quite complicated for every day use. We're streamlining this to allow a user to have a simple read or write privilege on each section while hiding away the underlying complexities.

###FM-16	Improve wording of CompliFlow emails when assigned back to the previous stage

###FM-29	Provide an error message when attempting to select assets from other sections

###FM-30	 If a download link is not accessible, a visual indicator is shown

###FM-50	Include a 'date received' as part of the complaints register
