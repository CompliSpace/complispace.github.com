title: Why Information Security Is Important
categories:

---

Today I had the opportunity to present a topic that has been on my mind for some time.
As IT professionals we are always telling our users to use strong passwords, to
be careful of all your online dealings, don't do this, don't do that...blah blah blah....

But why do we have to repeat ourselves? I'm thinking that perhaps we need to help
people understand why information has value, just like we intuitively know the value
of our credit cards or more tangible belongings. Once people understand the value
of information, protecting it becomes second nature. Just like your ATM PIN number!

Below is a recording of the presentation and various links to the resources used.

I hope you find it useful, and I appreciate any comments you may have.
