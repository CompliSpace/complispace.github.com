##Change Log
This month there are 3 specific issues with this update. 

###Issue 362 - Update Legacy Komodo Flash Player
The default flash player used by the base Komodo CMS system fails to play some
modern flash encoded movies.

This has been replaced with [flowplayer](http://flowplayer.org/).

###Issue 359 - Creation of Extra Layout Templates
A few more page layouts have been created to help with laying out your content.

**CompliSpace Technology strongly advises against using tables for layout.**

You can change the layout of a page by choosing from the Komodo menu:
`Komodo > Page Properties > Template Settings` and selecting the template from the
`Page Template` drop down.
